================

The Mobile Web Applications first assignment for my BSc Ordinary Degree in Digital Technologies and Design in Applications Development

Assignment 1: JQM List App

Assignment Breif:

The app should incorporate the following features.
1. Based on jQuery Mobile.
 
2. Present the user with an input box to filter the full list; i.e. a client-side search feature.

3. Use your own customized theme (ThemeRoller is fine but feel free to do something yourself if you prefer).

4. Customize some of the default components, e.g. buttons, etc.

5. Clicking on any list item should use a page transition to present a "page" with extra content specific to that item.  

6. Use only one single HTML file for the main content and functionality.

7. Assume that your app could be wired up to some server side data feed, but build it using mockup client-side content (i.e. a local JSON file.  Clearly indicate in your comments the portions of the code that you think should be dynamic if the app were using live data.

8. A collapsible side panel with some info about your app.  e.g. usage instructions or something similar.
